# Virtual Try-On Model (Totally Working)

**A plug-and-play offline virtual try-on system for fashion and e-commerce applications.**

---

##  Overview

Easily preview how a piece of clothing will look on a person using just two images — one of the person and one of the garment. This model requires no manual preprocessing and produces clean, realistic results with minimal setup, perfect for designers, developers, and vision enthusiasts.

---

##  Key Features

- Fully offline — no API or internet required  
- Requires only two images: person + garment  
- Automatic human parsing, pose detection, and cloth warping  
- High-quality output with realistic alignment  
- Simple, no-code script for easy usage  
- Built with Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV
