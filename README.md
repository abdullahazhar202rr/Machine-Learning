# Machine Learning & AI Projects

This repository contains my **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence** projects.  
It is an **active and growing portfolio** — I regularly add new work, improve existing models, and experiment with new ideas.

The projects cover a variety of domains such as **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Generative AI**, and other AI applications.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each project has its own dedicated folder with:
- **Code**: Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and training pipelines.
- **Documentation**: README or instructions specific to that project.
- **Assets**: Sample datasets, configurations, and results (large files and models are excluded via `.gitignore`).

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🖼 Computer Vision
- **Virtual Try-On Model (Totally Working)**  
  End-to-end system for trying on clothes virtually using human parsing, pose estimation, and garment warping.  
  Includes preprocessing pipelines with **OpenPose** and **Single-Human-Parsing-LIP**.

- **Object Detection**  
  - YOLOv3 implementation in Jupyter Notebook.  
  - Object detection with a **web backend** for real-time results.  
  - Fire & Smoke detection using PyTorch.

- **Package Label Detection**  
  Custom-trained model to detect package/shipping labels from images.

---

### 🤖 AI & Deep Learning Models
- **Image Classification Models** (CNN, ResNet, etc.)
- **Segmentation Models** for human parsing and object segmentation.
- **Custom Training Checkpoints** for PyTorch and TensorFlow.

---

### 📊 Data Processing & Utilities
- **Custom Data Pipelines** for cleaning, augmenting, and preparing datasets.
- **YOLO & Darknet** training and evaluation scripts.
- **Model Conversion Scripts** between formats like `.pth`, `.onnx`, `.tflite`.

## 📈 Ongoing Work
This is not a static repository — I am:
- Adding new AI/ML projects.
- Improving accuracy and efficiency of existing models.
- Experimenting with advanced architectures.

## ⚠️ Note
- Large datasets and model weights are excluded from the repo but may be linked in each project's README.
- For running these projects, please refer to each folder's documentation for **setup instructions** and **requirements**.
